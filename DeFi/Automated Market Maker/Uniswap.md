- **Uniswap v1 (2018)**
  <br/>The beginning. Allowed swaps between ETH and any ERC-20 token using a simple constant product formula (x * y = k). This was the first proof that AMMs could actually work in practice.
- **Uniswap v2 (2020)**
<br/>Expanded to ERC-20 <--> ERC-20 swaps directly. It also introduced important tools like price oracles and flash swaps. More flexibility, more pairs, more utility.
- **Uniswap v3 (2021)**
<br/>The game-changer: concentrated liquidity. Liquidity providers could choose specific price ranges to provide liquidity, making their capital far more efficient. It also introduced multiple fee tiers. But it came with complexity — LP positions became more like active strategies.
- **Uniswap v4**
<br/>A complete architectural shift.
- **Hooks** → Custom logic before/after swaps or liquidity changes (e.g., dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders).
- **Singleton contract** → All pools live inside one contract → cheaper multi-hop trades.
- **Flash accounting** → Better gas efficiency for complex trades.
- **Native ETH support** → No more wrapping/unwrapping overhead.
