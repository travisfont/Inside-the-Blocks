# Liquid Staking

Liquid staking token represents a staked deposit plus staking rewards. Unlike locked staking, one can use these tokens freely:
- Trade them on exchanges.
- Provide liquidity in DeFi (e.g., lending, yield farming, collateral for loans).
- Swap back to the underlying token anytime (with some slippage depending on liquidity).

 As validators earn staking rewards, the liquid staking token automatically reflects the yield (e.g., stETH balance increases over time).

**Benefits:**
- No lock-up: Token stays liquid.
- Composable: Ability to use staked assets in DeFi.
- Easy access: No need to own or individually run a validator or lock 32 ETH.
