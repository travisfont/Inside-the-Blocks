# VeChain (VET)

VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform designed for enterprise use, primarily focusing on supply chain management and traceability. It enables businesses to track products securely using blockchain, IoT devices like RFID chips, and smart contracts for transparency and anti-counterfeiting.

## Core Features

VeChain operates on the VeChainThor blockchain with a dual-token system: VET serves as the value-transfer token for staking, governance, and investments, while VTHO acts as "gas" for transaction fees, generated by holding VET to ensure cost stability.
The platform supports decentralized applications (DApps), NFTs, DeFi via VeUSD, and tools like VeChain ToolChain for low-code blockchain integration.

## History and Adoption

Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, formerly of Louis Vuitton China, VeChain has partnered with major firms like BMW, Walmart, Renault, LVMH, Deloitte, and PwC for real-world applications in logistics, food safety, luxury goods, and sustainability.
It emphasizes mass business adoption through scalable solutions, including fee delegation for freemium models and tamper-proof data recording.
